\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a weighted directed graph $G(V, E)$ and its corresponding weight matrix $W=(w_{ij})_{n \times n}$ and shortest path matrix $D=(d_{ij})_{n \times n}$, where $w_{ij}$ is the weight of edge $(v_i, v_j)$ and $d_{ij}$ is the weight of a shortest path from pairwise vertex $v_i$ to $v_j$. Now, assume the weight of a particular edge $(v_a, v_b)$ is decreased from $w_{ab}$ to $w'_{ab}$. Design an algorithm to update matrix $D$ with respect to this change, whose time complexity should be no larger than $O(n^2)$. Describe your design first and write down your algorithm in the form of pseudo-code.
    \begin{solution}
        For it has just changed one edge, the $b_{th}$ row of matrix $D$ can be updated by $w_{ab}^{'}$ and $D_{i,b}$. And for the rest element in $D$, it can be updated by the $b_{th}$ row. Because for all path, it can visit $b$ or not. The shortest path weight $d[i][j]=min\{d[i][b]+d[b][j],d[i][j]\}$
       
        Here is the pseudo-code.

        \begin{algorithm}[H]
            \KwIn{$G(V, E)$, $W=(w_{ij})_{n \times n}$, $D=(d_{ij})_{n \times n}$, $w'_{ab}$}
            \KwOut{updated $D=(d_{ij})_{n \times n}$}
            \BlankLine
            \caption{updated shortest path matrix}
    
            \For{$j=0$ to $n$}
            {
                $d[j][b]=min\{w^{'}[a][b]+d[j][a],d[j][b]\}$\;
            }
            \For{$i=0$ to $n$}
            {
                \For{$j=0$ to $n$}
                {
                    $d[i][j]=min\{d[i][b]+d[b][j],d[i][j]\}$\;
                }
                
            }
        \end{algorithm}
    And it's clear that the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.
    \end{solution}

	\item Given a directed graph $G$, whose vertices and edges information are introduced in data file ``SCC.in''. Please find its number of Strongly Connected Components with respect to the following subquestions.
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item Read the code and explanations of the provided C/C++ source code ``SCC.cpp'', and try to complete this implementation.
    	\item Visualize the above selected Strongly Connected Components for this graph $G$. Use the $Gephi$ or other software you preferred to draw the graph. {\color{blue}(If you feel that the data provided in ``SCC.in'' is not beautiful, you can also generate your own data with more vertices and edges than $G$ and draw an additional graph. Notice that results of your visualization will be taken into the consideration of Best Lab.)}

	\item The \textbf{Minimum Cost Maximum Flow} problem (MCMF) is an optimization problem to find the cheapest possible way of sending the maximum amount of flow through a flow network. That is, in a flow network $G = (V, E)$ with a source $s\in V$ and a sink $t\in V$, where each edge $(u, v)\in E$ has a capacity $c(u,v) > 0$ and a cost $a(u,v) \ge 0$, find a maximum $s\text{-}t$ flow $f$ over all edges ($f(u, v) \ge 0)$, such that the total cost of $\sum_{(u, v) \in E} a(u, v) \cdot f(u, v)$ is minimized.

A common greedy approach to solve the MCMF problem can be described as follows: We can modify Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, where each time we choose the least cost path from $s$ to $t$. To do this correctly, when we add a back-edge to some edge $e$ into the residual graph, we give it a cost of $-a(e)$, representing that we get our money back if we undo the flow on it.

Note that such procedure may create a residual graph with negative-weight edges, which is not suitable for Dijkstra's Algorithm. However, motivated by Johnson's Algorithm, we can reweight the edge cost with vertex labels and convert the weight non-negative again.

Please prove the correctness of such greedy approach and implement this algorithm in C/C++. The file \emph{MCMF.in} is a test case, where the first line contains four graph parameters $n$, $m$, $s$, $t$, and the rest $m$ lines exhibit the information of $m$ edges. Each line contains four integers: $u_i$, $v_i$, $c_i$, $a_i$, denoting that there is an edge from $u_i$ to $v_i$ with capacity $c_i$ and cost $a_i$. {\color{blue}(Your source code should be named as \emph{MCMF.cpp} and output the maximum flow and minimum cost of this test case.)}

    \begin{proof}
        Now we prove it by induction. Assume $f(x)$ is the minimized cost flow when flow is equal to $x$.

        And $f$ is a minimized cost flow which is equal to that the residual graph has no negative circle.
        Or the cost can be smaller by visiting these negative circles.

        \textbf{Basics.}

        It's clear that $f(0)=0$.

        \textbf{Induction proof.}

        Assume $f(k)$ is the minimized cost flow. And $f(k+1)$ is the flow induced by our algorithm.
        Thus $f(k+1)-f(k)$ is a shortest path from $s$ to $t$.

        Now we assume there is another flow $f'(k+1)$ with lower cost. There must exist  negative circles in $f'(i+1)-f(i)$, which causes a contradiction.

        Therefore $f'(k+1)$ is the minimized cost flow. And the algorithm is correct.

    \end{proof}
